				The author would like to apologize for making Mapeditor available as a Windows program.
				</p>
				
				<h2 id="description">Overview</h2>
				<p><em>Mapeditor</em> is a Perl program, available free of charge (please refer to <a href="#license">license</a> for details),
				designed as a basic tool to create and edit maps for various board games.</p>
				<p>Using <em>Mapeditor</em> you can for example create a map similar to the following in a matter of minutes:</p>
				<p class="center">
					<img alt="Map example" src="img/en/map.png"/>
				</p>
				<p>
				<em>Mapeditor</em> can easily be extended thanks to a modular pack system that allows you to add and remove tile graphics with little efforts.</p>
				<h2 id="changes">History</h2>

				<h2 id="downloads">Download</h2>
				<p>Source code as well as Linux and Windows binaries are available at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/bgmapeditor/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/bgmapeditor/</a>.</p>
				<h2 id="installation">Installing</h2>
				<p>Uncompress the archive into the preferred location.</p>
				<p>Double Click the binary applicable to your operating system (<em>mapeditor.bin</em> for Linux, <em>mapeditor.exe</em> for Windows).</p>
				<p>It is also possible to execute the <em>mapeditor.pl</em> Perl script directly if the following modules and dependencies are installed and working: Tk, GD</p>
				<h2 id="interface">User Interface</h2>
				<p class="center">
					<img alt="Global UI" src="img/en/ui_global.png"/>
				</p>
				<p>
				<p>The main area can be used like a drawing board where you can add, move, rotate or delete tiles with simple mouse actions.</p>
				<p>The result of clicking with the mouse on the canvas (using the left mouse button) can be changed in two ways:</p>
				<p>- click on the local menu items just above the canvas</p>
				<p>- using shortcuts</p>
				<p>The 'mode' the mouse is set to will remain active until it is changed to a different one allowing for quick editing.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Add a tile or object (<code>&lt;n&gt;</code>).</li>
					<li>Move a tile or object (<code>&lt;Espace&gt;</code>).</li>
					<li>Rotate a tile or object (<code>&lt;r&gt;</code>).</li>
					<li>Delete a tile or object (<code>&lt;d&gt;</code>).</li>
				</ul>
				You can change the object to be inserted by selecting the appropriate item on the left hand side of the canvas.
				</p>

				<h2 id="packs">Graphical Resources</h2>
				<p>The tile graphics can be tailored to a particular board game. By packing the images into a Zip file you can import your custom set quite easily.</p>
				<p>First create a parent directory and name it after your pack.</p>
				<p>Then create as many subdirectories as required inside this top directory:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>tiles (playing surface)</li>
					<li>corridors and halls</li>
					<li>walls and doors</li>
					<li>miscellaneous props</li>
					<li>any other items you would like to include</li>
				</ul>				
				<p><em>If a subdirectory starts with an underscore "_" the resources will be treated as objects to be used as an overlay on top of the background tiles. 
				Subdirectories starting with a dash "-" will be treated as intermediate layers between the background and overlaying objects.
				They are typically used as zone delimiters.</em>
				</p>

				<p>You can see examples here: <a href="https://www.zombicide.com/en/zombicide-mapeditor/">Zombicide Packs</a>.</p>
				
				<p>GIF, PNG et JPEG are all acceptable file formats but formats that support transparency such as GIF or PNG come highly recommended.</p>
				
				<h3>Adding a pack</h3>
				<p>To add a pack select the appropriate entry from the Pack menu and browse to the pack you wish to install. 
				Once selected the images are automatically converted and the original Zip archive can be discarded if desired.</p>
				<p>
				<em>WARNING: tiles and other graphics are not scaled in any way</em>. This means that all pictures will require sizing
				appropriately before packing and importing.</p>
				<h3>Remove a pack</h3>
				<p>To delete a pack simply delete the pack folder from <code>./img/tiles</code>.</p>
				<p><em>WARNING: All maps created with the tiles and objects that you subsequently delete will not display properly!</em></p>
				<h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>multiple selection and edition of the objects composing a map</li>
					<li>management of user packs with similar names</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Note</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Undo/Redo can take an astronomical amount of resources for complex map with a high number of objects.</li>
				</ul>
